    "However, it is not an easy one due to several un-certainties in detection using mammograms. Machine Learning techniques can be used to develop tools for physicians that can be used as an effective mechanism for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer which will greatly enhance the survival rate of patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "There had been numerous research work done on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset for prediction of breast cancer. \n",
    "\n",
    "[2] Bazazeh and Shubair (2016) have made a comparison among the three most popular classification techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Networks (BN) and claimed that, on this dataset the accuracy of SVM is about 97%. \n",
    "\n",
    "The autors decribe the ML techniques and that these can ve divided into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, a set of data instances are used to train the machine and are labeled to give the correct result. However, in unsupervised learning, there are no pre-determined data sets and no notion of the expected outcome, which means that the goal is harder to achieve.\n",

    "[3] Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges.
