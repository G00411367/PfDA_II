    "Breast cancer is one of the most widespread diseases among women. Correct and early diagnosis is an extremely important step in rehabilitation and treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is not an easy one due to several un-certainties in detection using mammograms. Machine Learning techniques can be used to develop tools for physicians that can be used as an effective mechanism for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer which will greatly enhance the survival rate of patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset was obtained by imaging needle-tip-wide breast mass with biopsy by Dr. William Wolberg, an employee of Wisconsin Hospital. Samples were examined under microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present.\n",
    "Specific atributes were developed for samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In colaboration with University of Wisconsin-Madison, computer software department a software called Xcyt was used to perform cytological feature analysis based on the digital scan. This software applies a curve-fitting algorithm to calculate ten features by returning each feature’s mean value, worst value, and standard error (SE) value. Thus, there were 30 values in total for each sample, to which we have added an ID column to differentiate these samples. Finally, the diagnosis result of each sample, which consisted of malignant (M) and benign (B), was also added. [6]\n",

    "* Uniformity of Cell Shape: (1-10). Cancer cells tend to vary in shape and size.\n",
    "* Marginal Adhesion: (1-10). Normal cells tend to stick together while cancer cells tend to lose this ability, so the loss of adhesion is a sign of malignancy.\n",
    "* Single Epithelial Cell Size: (1-10). It is related to the uniformity mentioned above. Epithelial cells that are significantly enlarged may be a malignant cell.\n",
    "* Bare Nuclei: (1-10). This is a term used for nuclei not surrounded by cytoplasm (the rest of the cell). Those are typically seen in benign tumors.\n",
    "* Bland Chromatin: (1-10). Describes a uniform \"texture\" of the nucleus seen in benign cells. In cancer cells, the chromatin tends to be more coarse and to form clumps.\n",
    "* Normal Nucleoli: (1-10). Nucleoli are small structures seen in the nucleus. In normal cells, the nucleolus is usually very small if visible at all. The nucleoli become more prominent in cancer cells, and sometimes there are multiple.\n",
    "* Mitoses: (1-10). Cancer is essentially a disease of uncontrolled mitosis.\n",
    "* Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant). Benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) lump in a breast.\n",

    "There had been numerous research work done on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset for prediction of breast cancer. \n",

    "[2] Bazazeh and Shubair (2016) have made a comparison among the three most popular classification techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Networks (BN) and claimed that, on this dataset the accuracy of SVM is about 97%. \n",
    "The autors decribe the ML techniques and that these can ve divided into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, a set of data instances are used to train the machine and are labeled to give the correct result. However, in unsupervised learning, there are no pre-determined data sets and no notion of the expected outcome, which means that the goal is harder to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wisconsisn breast cancer dataset fals into clasiication type which is among the most common methods for supervised learning. It uses historical labeled data to develop a model that is then used for future predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is a classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier in machine learning is an algorithm that automatically orders or categorizes data into one or more of a set of “classes.” One of the most common examples is an email classifier that scans emails to filter them by class label: Spam or Not Spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are both supervised and unsupervised classifiers. Unsupervised machine learning classifiers are fed only unlabeled datasets, which they classify according to pattern recognition or structures and anomalies in the data. Supervised and semi-supervised classifiers are fed training datasets, from which they learn to classify data according to predetermined categories. [8]\n",
    "\n",
    "According to \"Toward science\" [9] the top 6 machine learning algorithms for classification problems are: \n",
    "* logistic regression\n",
    "* decision tree\n",
    "* random forest\n",
    "* support vector machine\n",
    "* k nearest neighbour \n",
    "* naive bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of clasifiers used in the reasearch [2] published by Bazazeh and Shubair\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suport Vector Machine \n",
    "\n",
    "[3] Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However,  it is mostly used in classification problems. Support Vectors are simply the coordinates of individual observation. The SVM classifier is a frontier that best segregates the two classes (hyper-plane/ line).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Picture Binom](images/SVM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "[4] Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Picture Binom](images/RF.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bayesian Network\n",
    "\n",
    "[5] A Bayesian Network is a probabilistic graphical model which represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies using a directed acyclic graph. Bayesian networks are probabilistic, because these networks are built from a probability distribution, and also use probability theory for prediction and anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian Network can be used for building models from data and experts opinions. A Bayesian Network graph is made up of \"Nodes\" and \"Arcs\" (directed links). Each node corresponds to the random variables.\n",
    "Arc or directed arrows represent the causal relationship or conditional probabilities between random variables\n",
